# Plex-Collection-Agent
A small GUI-Tool to add Meta to Plex Collections.

This is an early alpha version of the program. Feel free to open an issue with bugs or feature requests. I will do my best!

Either download the prebuild version from GitHub or build it yourself.
If you want to build it by yourself. Clone the project and run:
1. With npm: "npm install" and "npm run build-exe"
2. With yarn: "yarn install" and "yarn run build-exe"

The output is an zip file in the dist directory.
